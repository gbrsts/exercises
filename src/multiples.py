# Read three point floating values (A, B and C) and verify if is possible to make a triangle with them. If it is possible, calculate the perimeter of the triangle and print the message:
# Perimetro = xx.x
# If it is not possible, calculate the area of the trapezium which basis A and B and C as height, and print the message:
# Area = XX.X
